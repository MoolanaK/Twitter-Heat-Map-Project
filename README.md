To run this just add your twitter API key on line 10. Make a TwitterHeatMap object by running TwitterHeatMap('<USER_TWITTER_HANDLE>') in a python console. This will build, show and save a heatmap of the User's activity over the past week.  
Example of how the heat map will look: https://imgur.com/a/E5nqbQJ
